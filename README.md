# 1dofsetup
A one degree of freedom exo-skelleton. The exo-skelleton uses a two stage gear reduction to be able to provide enough torque using NEMA17 stepper motor. This setup has been designed to be used with a stepper motor that has resistor connected so that it behaves like damper. This setup has NOT been tested with a stepper motor connected to a non-passive system, such as stepper motor driver, and using it in this way could cause damage to the user.
